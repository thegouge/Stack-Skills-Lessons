                            - RG-Kick: Rapid Gravity Kick performed by G-Canceling the G-Kick then activating another in sequence (square->L1->R1->square <br>

                            All health upgrades are optional and should be used dependant on circumstances.
                            The route is pretty tight on gems until Nushi so try not to spend too much on health
                            so you don’t miss other important upgrades. <br>

                            When you start a run make sure to close and reopen the application so that the settings are default <br>

                            Steven Seagal was an action star, and successful cop, and energy drink endorser.
                            Until he decided the nonstop action of hollywood and the patrol beat were too much
                            for him. So he settled down and hung his hat to become the single greatest
                            real-Estate broker the world has ever known. He sells houses at an almost criminal rate.
                            and can make chocolate chip cookie smell so authentic, you'll actually be searching the house
                            for where the damn cookies are. But will his past come back to haunt him? Find out in... <br>
